# THE PROJECT WAS ABANDONED ‚ö†Ô∏è
**The project was abandoned due to the fact that the R4D1 Software organization no longer uses discord for privacy reasons. Therefore, no one from our organization can continue this project. If you are willing to continue this project please contact us at support@vexsus.eu.**

**Due to the abandonment of the project, I would also like to inform that there is no version 2.0 of this project.**

# Installation

First, you need to download the latest installer from the [Releases](https://github.com/VEXSUS/WSA-Discord-RPC/releases/tag/1.4.0_stable) tab. There you can choose between pre-release and stable release versions. (At the moment only stable version is available. Windows Insider and pre-release versions will be released soon)

## Windows 11 Registry
As of version 1.4.0, the WSA Discord RPC uses a method of writing values to an .ini file. We have abandoned the use of the Windows 11 registry for security reasons. The program continues to run in administrator mode due to the fact that it needs to remove remnants that were left in the registry after the previous installation. Because the previous uninstallers of the program do not remove the registry entries with these values.

* OneDriveSync - This value is used to sync with the "OneDrive" folder in Windows 11.
* OneDriveDIR - The path to your OneDrive folder
* InstallationID - This value will allow future identification of the given installation on the user's computer. This way, if the user is sending diagnostic data, we will know exactly who is sending it, without the need to know their for example serial numbers, ip address etc. Each installation id is UNIQUE !
* RunOnProgramStartup - This registry entry is responsible for whether or not you want the status to appear on discord when you run the program. (By default this feature is enabled after initial setup).
* TrayMode - Value which checks at program startup whether to enter "Tray Mode".

## Screenshots

```

Google Authenticator, Twitch, Twitter and Twitter Lite
